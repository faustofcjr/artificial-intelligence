3. Explore os dados para obter insights

## 1. Look at the big picture

### 1.1 What are business goals?

Based on the conditions of the passengers (class of ticket, sex, age, among others), predict which of them would be more likely to survive the Titanic accident.

### 1.2 How the solution will be used?
It's just to familiarize myself with how competitions on the Kaggle platform works.

### 1.3 What are the current solutions or workarounds (if any)?
It does not apply in this context.

### 1.4 How should you classify the problema?
- [x] Supervised learning
- [ ] Unsupervised learning
- [ ] Reinforcement learning
- [ ] Online
- [x] Offline

### 1.5 How performance should be measured?
The dataset is very simple and small. Do not demand high perfomance from possibles solutions.

### 1.6 The performance measure is aligned with the business objective?
- [x] Yes
- [] No

### 1.7 What would be the minimum performance required to achieve the business objective?
Not a lot.

### 1.8 What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experiences or tools?
Other models already submitted on the Kaggle platform.

### 1.9 There is Human expertise available?
- [ ] Yes
- [x] No

### 1.10. How would you solve the problem manually?
Looking at resources like https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivors.

### 1.11. List assumptions you or anothers have made so far?
- Women and children were more chance to suviver.
- First-class members had advantage of getting into the lifeboat.
- On the night of sinking, the temperature was around 4.1°C and ocean approximately 4°C.
- Third-class passengers did not have easy access to the upper deck.
- The number of third-class members who dit not survive was the highest of first and second classes.
- About 80% of the crew member did not survive.
- Lifeboat with no maximum number of passengers.

### 1.12. Check assumptions if possible.
